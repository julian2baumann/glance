# Glance Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 18, 2026

## The Short Version

We collect no data. We transmit no data. Everything stays on your device.

## The Full Version

Glance is a local-only iOS application. All health data you enter is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework, which benefits from iOS filesystem encryption when your device is locked.

**What we collect:** Nothing. Glance has no analytics, no crash reporting that phones home, no advertising frameworks, and no user accounts.

**What we transmit:** Nothing. Glance makes no network requests of any kind.

**Data export:** When you explicitly use the Export feature, Glance creates a file containing your health data and presents it via the iOS share sheet. You control where that file goes. The file is not encrypted — treat it as sensitive health information.

**Third-party SDKs:** None. Zero.

**Changes to this policy:** If this policy changes in a future version, we will note it here with a new effective date.
